# git-utils

A set of git utilities I wanted, inspired by [Joels git-branch-i](https://github.com/JoelOtter/git-branch-i).

Install with:
```bash
cargo install --git https://github.com/manpat/git-utils
```
and optionally make sure that `.cargo/bin` is in your `PATH`.

Then you can install git aliases for subcommands with
```bash
git-utils install

# or if .cargo/bin isn't in your path
~/.cargo/bin/git-utils install
```
